# InviteR - Event Invitation Management System

InviteR is a modular platform for managing event invitations, guest lists, and automated WhatsApp messaging. It is built as a microservices architecture with a React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, a dedicated WhatsApp service, and MongoDB for storage. The system is fully Dockerized for easy deployment and development.

## Quick Start with Docker
**Recommended for most users!**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd InviteR
   ```
2. **Build and start all services:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This will start:
   - MongoDB (port 27017)
   - Backend API (port 5002)
   - WhatsApp service (port 5010)
   - Frontend (port 5173)

3. **Access the app:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002)
   - WhatsApp Service: [http://localhost:5010](http://localhost:5010)

4. **First-time WhatsApp setup:**
   - Run: `docker logs -f inviter-whatsapp`
   - Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp app (Menu > WhatsApp Web > Scan QR)
   - The WhatsApp service must remain connected for messaging to work.

---

## Local Development (without Docker)
**For advanced users and contributors.**

1. **Install dependencies for each service:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   cd ../whatsapp-service && npm install
   ```
2. **Start MongoDB locally** (or use Docker for MongoDB only):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name inviter-mongo mongo:6
   ```
3. **Start each service in a separate terminal:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   cd whatsapp-service && node sendWhatsAppWave.js
   ```
4. **WhatsApp QR (local):**
   - The QR code will appear in your terminal on first run.
   - If you need to reset the session, delete `/tmp/whatsapp-session` and restart the service.

---

## WhatsApp Service: QR Code & Troubleshooting
- **First run:** The WhatsApp service prints a QR code in the terminal/logs. Scan it with your phone.
- **No QR code?** Delete the session folder (`/tmp/whatsapp-session` in Docker, or `whatsapp-service/session/` locally) and restart the service.
- **Browser errors (Puppeteer):**
  - If you see `Failed to launch the browser process!`, make sure Chromium is installed (Docker handles this automatically).
  - For local dev, let Puppeteer download its own Chromium (do not set `executablePath`).
- **Session expired/disconnected:** Delete the session folder and rescan the QR code.
- **Multiple WhatsApp accounts:** Each session is tied to one WhatsApp account. To switch, delete the session and restart.

---

## Environment Variables
- **backend/.env** (example):
  ```env
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/inviter
  JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
  NODE_ENV=development
  ```
- **frontend/.env** (example):
  ```env
  VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5002
  ```
- **whatsapp-service/.env** (optional):
  ```env
  PORT=5010
  ```
- When using Docker Compose, most variables are set in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## Useful Commands
- **Docker Compose:**
  - `docker compose up --build` ‚Äì Build and start all services
  - `docker compose down` ‚Äì Stop all services
  - `docker logs -f inviter-whatsapp` ‚Äì View WhatsApp QR and logs
- **Backend:**
  - `npm run dev` ‚Äì Start backend in dev mode
- **Frontend:**
  - `npm run dev` ‚Äì Start frontend in dev mode
- **WhatsApp Service:**
  - `node sendWhatsAppWave.js` ‚Äì Start WhatsApp service (local dev)

## Common Issues & Solutions
### WhatsApp QR code not showing
- **Solution:** Delete the session folder (`/tmp/whatsapp-session` or `whatsapp-service/session/`), then restart the service.

### Puppeteer/Chromium errors
- **Solution:**
  - In Docker: Chromium is pre-installed.
  - Locally: Let Puppeteer download its own browser (do not set `executablePath`).

### Backend can't reach WhatsApp service
- **Solution:**
  - In Docker: Use the service name (`inviter-whatsapp`) as the host, not `localhost`.
  - Locally: Use `localhost:5010`.

### MongoDB connection issues
- **Solution:**
  - Ensure MongoDB is running (check Docker or local process).
  - Check `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` or `docker-compose.yml`.

### Port already in use
- **Solution:**
  - Find and kill the process using the port (e.g., `lsof -i :5002` then `kill <pid>`).
  - Or change the port in the config.

### Updating WhatsApp session/account
- **Solution:** Delete the session folder and restart the WhatsApp service to scan a new QR code.
